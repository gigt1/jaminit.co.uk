Welcome Welcome. If you're a regular on this site you'll probably realise that I have massively rebranded my site. This is due to some of the following reasons:


 * First off when I was playing around with WordPress on my site, I was trying to change the subdirectory in where my site was stored and accidentally stopped my site from working. This was because I was directly editing wp-config.php and had **no** idea what I was doing. I realise this probably could be fixed easily if I did some searching around online however it gave me an excuse to change
 * Also, I wanted a change from WordPress, as amazing as it is there is lots of points of failure and it is quite slow and hard to modify.

This meant that I needed to find a different blogging platform and I had a search around and found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
## What is Jekyll
> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, > GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under the open source MIT license.

Basically Jekyll is a really easy way to create static sites and blogs, its easy to write pages (you can write them in markdown) and it doesn't require any databases. This means you can literally host the whole of your website on Github for **free**!
