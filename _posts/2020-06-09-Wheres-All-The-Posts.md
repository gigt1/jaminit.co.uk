title: Where's all the posts gone?
---
You may have noticed that the blog looks totally different and all the content is missing. Let me explain where all the content has gone.


I've recently migrated to Jekyll, since it easier to use and more simple, if you want a more in depth to why I switched see [this post]({% post_url 2020-06-09-Welcome %}). However, if you want to view all the old content you can view it on [archive.org here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200602135933/https://jaminit.co.uk/home/). At some point I will port all the content over to the new site but in the meantime please use that link! If you have any suggestions on what content you would like me to post you can do by contacting me [here](/contact/). Thanks!
