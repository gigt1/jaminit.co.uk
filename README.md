# jaminit.co.uk
This repo contains all the Jekyll files for my website. Its based on the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) theme
# To build
To build the site you'll need [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed and then clone the repo and run `bundle update`. Then to build just run `jekyll build`. You can also download a copy of the latest build [here](https://jenkins.jaminit.co.uk/job/JamInIT/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build.zip)
