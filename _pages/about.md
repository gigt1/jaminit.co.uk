Hi there, my names James Cook and I'm a student from England. I love web design and programming and am currently helping out on [OTIS](https://otis.leedsraspjam.co.uk/), which is a project operated by me and a few others. I also regularly go to [Leeds Rasperry Jam](https://www.leedsraspjam.co.uk/) and also attend various other groups (such as a hackathon). In my spare time I design websites for myself of clients and also write various other little scripts. If you want to contact me please visit the [contact page](/contact/)
