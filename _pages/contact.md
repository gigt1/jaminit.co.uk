# Ways to contact me
## Email: [james@jaminit.co.uk](mailto:james@jaminit.co.uk)
This is the best way to contact me with any questions you may have.
## Twitter: [@jamesatjaminit](https://twitter.com/jamesatjaminit)
If you want to contact me via Twitter you can do as well since I use this a lot.
## Other social media: [Social Page](/social/)
All the other social media listed on my social media page are active but I'd prefer you to use the methods above as they are easier to use
# What I won't respond to
* Any marketing emails wanting me to buy your services - I will be much more likely to purchase your products if I find it through Google, not an email. Please don't ask me if I want your service.
* Emails asking to promote your product - I'm not looking for any ad spots for free or paid at the moment. Please don't contact me asking for them.
