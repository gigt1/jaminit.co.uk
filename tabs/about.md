Hi there, my names James Cook and I'm a student from England. I love web design and programming and am currently helping out on OTIS, which is a project operated by me and a few others. I also regularly go to [Leeds Rasperry Jam](https://twitter.com/LeedsRaspJam) and also attend various other groups (such as a hackathon). In my spare time I design websites for myself of clients and also write various other little scripts. If you want to directly contact me you can do so at [james@jaminit.co.uk](mailto:james@jaminit.co.uk). Otherwise please contact me using one of the social media's below!
